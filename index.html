        <h1>Mac & Windows: Which is Better?</h1>
        <div id="apple">
            <h2>Mac:</h2>

            <p>the Mac, iMac & MacBook are devices across a range of form factors and sizes made entirely in-house by Apple. They're known for their high build quality,
                high prices, clear screens and great speakers. They also have a reputation in the tech enthusiast space for their lack of repairability, caused by Apple
                taking actions such as soldering RAM & storage directly to the board to prevent replacement or upgrading, and other anti-repair decisions.
            </p>
            <p>modern Mac devices use in-house Apple ARM-based chips known as the M-series of chips, most recent at the time of writing being the M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max.
                previously they used standard x86 Intel chips. The M-series Mac devices are considerably faster and more efficient than the Intel Macs ever were though,
                so it's generally seen as a good move.

            <p>if you can't tell, Macs, like all Apple products, are insanely expensive. It's ultimately for the end user to decide if the device is worth that much for them.</p>

            <h2>Windows:</h2>

            <p>Windows, unlike the Mac, isn't a set brand of computer, but an operating system used by many computers across the world by different manufacturers entirely.
                Windows has been in development by Microsoft since the 70s, starting as a GUI addon to MS-DOS, a text-based operating system, until Windows 2000 moved to "NT",
                removing the reliance on the MS-DOS back-end after almost 30 years. Today, Windows 11 is the newest version, but many machines still run Windows 10, or even
                older versions past their end of support dates like Windows 8.1, 7, or XP.
                Windows laptops come in all shapes and sizes, and are built for a variety of purposes. Some are low-power machines meant only to be able to work all day,
                others are purpose-built to run videogames, at the cost of only having a couple of hours of battery life, and others are meant to strike a balance between.
                Windows laptops can come with or without touchscreens, fingerprint readers, any assortment of screen resolutions and technologies, and all varieties of ports along the sides.
